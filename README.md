# Cold_Email_Generator_Project
End-to-End Generative AI project using Llama 3.1, ChromaDB, Langchain, and Streamlit to develop a Cold Email Generator Tool  

The developed cold email generator will extract essential information such as skills and job description from a job posting URL and crafts an email allowing software technology providers (companies like Infosys, TCS, AtliQ, Microsoft) to efficiently communicate with potential clients (companies such as Kroger, JP Morgan & Chase) to secure projects in the competitive market. The tool significantly reduces time spent writing detailed emails to potential clients allowing time available for other essential business operations to be conducted.
